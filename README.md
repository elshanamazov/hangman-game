This is a project of the classic game **"Hangman"**, developed using modern technologies.

The game asks the player to guess words by hiding their letters. Each incorrect attempt brings the player closer to losing. Two design themes are implemented: light and dark, which allows users to choose their preferred interface style. The game is adapted for different devices; the Tailwind CSS framework was used for styling.


**Stack**: HTML/CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, Vite
